  "summary": "**Justin a.k.a APXNR (f.k.a. \"cyberart\\_by\\_justin\")**\n\nI've been a digital artist for going on 8 years now. Starting with Processing all the way back in 2016. Started out making small artworks with it in between my classes, which got me into programming in general. That's how my Instagram page started in the first place: with Processing sketches!\n\nAfter I graduated, I started to take the art a bit more seriously: venturing into Photoshop, especially after receiving a few clients. I started experimenting with glitchy visuals, even incorporating Processing scripts to help edit images. Thus, I started to really develop my own unique style resulting in my page really blowing up back in 2018/2019.\n\nStarted growing more and more over the years, but eventually wanted to take a break from making art, but the itch was still there. So recently, I started also picking up Touchdesigner to add to my skillset. I created quite a few videos to again develop a unique style, which also came with a bit of rebranding.\n\nThe name \"APXNR\" comes from another name I had back in high school/early college: \"Apex Noir\". I seriously don't even know how I came up with the name; I just thought of it and it stuck as a musician/producer name. So I'm kind of bringing that back and merging my current artist identity with my producer identity. \n\n**Thus: APXNR**"
